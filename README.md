# LangChain_Document_Processing_RAG

LangChain RAG: End-to-End Document Processing

Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive guide on implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain. The notebook demonstrates how to work with LangChain’s key components, including loaders, splitters, embeddings, and vector stores.

By following this notebook, you will learn how to process and embed textual data efficiently, making it accessible for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like document retrieval, search, and AI-assisted summarization.

Features

📂 Load Text Documents: Work with .txt and .pdf files using TextLoader and PyPDFLoader.

📝 Split Documents: Efficiently chunk large text documents with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

🔍 Embed Text Data: Use HuggingFaceEmbeddings to convert text into vector representations.

📚 Vector Storage & Retrieval: Store embeddings in a vector database and perform similarity searches.

⚡ LangChain Integration: Explore how LangChain facilitates NLP workflows.

Dataset Used

The notebook works with two example files:

state_of_union.txt: A transcript of the U.S. State of the Union address.

michael_resume.pdf: A sample resume used for document screening.
